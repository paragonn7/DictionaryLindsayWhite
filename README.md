# Blazor Dictionary
***
This is an in-memory Dictonary web app built with Blazor. This is my first attempt at using Blazor and I can certainly say I learned a lot from the process.<br/>

## REQUIREMENTS<br/>
-.NET SDK 5.0.100 or greater<br/>
-Chrome

### RECOMMENDED<br/>
Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.9.4

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING<br/>
1) Clone repo
2) Open command line and "cd c:/whereyouclonedit"
3) Enter "dotnet watch run" command
4) A browser tab should open with the app on localhost

## HELPFUL INFO<br/>
I have not been able to get any kid of Blazor/Razor syntax highlighting, intellisense, or formatting to work. So if you're checking out the code there's a good chance you'll need to read it like you would in the olden days.
